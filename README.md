# pentominoes-puzzle-solver
The programs are designed to run with Clingo to find solutions for a specific puzzle involving the placement of 12 unique pentominoes on a 10x6 grid. The grid is divided into two smaller 5x6 grids by a horizontal line, and the goal is to arrange the pentominoes such that:
- All 12 pieces fit within the 10x6 grid.
- No part of any pentomino overlaps the line separating the two smaller grids.

To solve this puzzle, two variants of the puzzle solver are provided:

- `puzzle_solverv1.lp`: Outputs all possible solutions.
- `puzzle_solverv2.lp`: Outputs only the fundamentally different solutions by removing symmetrical or redundant ones.

  
A visualizer was created with the assistance of ChatGPT to display the final solutions. This visualizer requires Pygame. Ensure you have Pygame installed by running the following command if itâ€™s not already installed:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
## Mini guide 
- If you already have solutions from the Clingo program saved in a JSON file, you can skip the next step.
- Generate solutions by running the following command (example for the first puzzle solver):
    ```bash
    clingo pentomino_encoder.db puzzle_solverv1.lp --outf=2 -n 2 -t 8 > sol.json
    ```
   - This command executes the ASP programs with Clingo, outputting the results in a JSON format (--outf=2).
   - It generates up to 2 solution models (-n 2) and runs in parallel mode using 8 threads (-t 8). The output will be saved to sol.json.
- Visualize the solutions by running the Python script:
    ```bash
    python visualize.py sol.json
    ```
- A Pygame window will open, displaying the solutions. If multiple solutions exist, use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate through them.
## Solutions files 
Some solutions files are given in the repository, I'll explain what they are used for :
- `sol.json`: Contains 20 stable models found by the first version of the puzzle solver (puzzle_solverv1.lp).
- `sol2.json`: Contains 20 stable models after fixing the Pentomino T on a specific side of the grid.
- `sol3.json`: Contains 8 models, found after fixing the Pentomino T on a specific side and removing symmetrical solutions for that side.
- `sol4.json`: Contains the 2 final models, representing the fundamentally different solutions.

By using these pre-generated files or generating your own, you can explore and visualize the solutions interactively!
